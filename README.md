# Hello!

I'm currently learning Python and have been actively studying and practising it for the past two years. I'm passionate about problem-solving and enjoy building small projects to improve my skills. This repository contains a collection of my learning materials, exercises, and project demos.

I'm now starting to look for junior developer roles, and I plan to use this space to showcase my work during job interviews. Please feel free to explore the code and let me know if you have any feedback or questions.
