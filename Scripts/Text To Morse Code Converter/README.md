# Text To Morse Code Converter

It runs in the terminal.

It converts the input texts to Morse code. The application is only capable of converting plain text to Morse code. The reverse conversation doesn't work. If the input is Morse code, the output will be Morse code too, and the input is handled as plain text.

The application can be tested on my website, too.
