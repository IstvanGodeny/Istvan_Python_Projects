# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe – Python Minimax AI

A console-based Tic Tac Toe (X and O) game built in pure Python.
You play against an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm, which always makes the optimal move.

---
## ✨ Features
- Play Tic Tac Toe directly in the terminal
- AI opponent using Minimax for unbeatable strategy
- Detects wins, draws, and invalid moves
- Accepts grid-style coordinates (A1, B2, C3, etc.)
- Fully text-based — no external libraries required

---
## 🖥️ Cross-Platform Support

This app runs on:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux

> ✅ No installation required — only Python 3.8+

---
## 🎓 Author Note

This is a demo project, created as part of my learning journey as a junior Python developer.
I focused on building a functional, maintainable, and visually clean app, without unnecessary complexity.

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the script:
```bash
python python tic_tac_toe.py
```
3. Enter your name, then play by typing positions like:

Example: A1, B2, C3
4. The AI will make its move after yours — try to beat it (if you can 😄).

The application can also be tested online.

## 💡 Educational Purpose
This script demonstrates:
- Implementation of the Minimax algorithm
- Basic AI decision-making
- Game loop logic and board management
- Clean and readable Python structure
It’s a great mini-project for learning how simple AI logic can be applied in turn-based games.

🧩 Future Ideas
- Add a GUI version (using PySide6, Kivy or Tkinter)
- Track scores across rounds
- Add a difficulty level (easy/medium/hard)

This is a simplified version of the game. You play against an AI using the minimax algorithm.
